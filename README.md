# Project Overview
Nand2Tetris is a fantastic educational project that takes you on a step-by-step adventure, starting with the fundamental NAND gate and progressing to a high-level programming language.

This repository will showcase my work on the various projects, including:

**Projects 1-3:** Explore basic digital logic gates, build multiplexers, and design a simple arithmetic logic unit (ALU).

**Projects 4-6:** Implement control flow with a memory access controller and build a central processing unit (CPU).

**Projects 7-9:** Design a computer memory system and interface it with the CPU to create a functional computer.

**Projects 10-12:** Explore assembly language programming and build a high-level assembler and operating system.

**Note:** I'm currently working on Project 4.

## Resources
**Learning Resources:** Refer to the official Nand2Tetris course materials (https://www.nand2tetris.org/) for detailed explanations, tutorials, and problem sets.
